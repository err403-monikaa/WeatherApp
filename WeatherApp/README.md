To access the API, you need to sign-up for an account. Once logged in, you can find an API Key under the setup tab. Since the API is public access, the key needs to be added as a parameter to whatever API endpoint you send a request to.

## MVC Architecture

Weather-App  follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for a clean and scalable codebase.

- The model encapsulates the data and business logic related to application.

- The view handles the presentation of tasks and user interactions. 

- The controller manages user input and updates the Model and View accordingly. It orchestrates the flow of data between the Model and View.
